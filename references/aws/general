SYSTEMS MANAGER SETUP
    - EC2

        CONFIGURE PERMISSIONS, VPC AND ENDPOINTS
        - Configure IAM user
            - Create policy (session-manager-instance-role)
            - Create IAM user (developer)
                - Attach policy to user
        - Configure Instance
            - Create a policy for the Instance (session-manager-instance-policy)
            - Create an IAM role for the Instance (session-manager-instance-role)
                - Attach instance policy to instance role
        - Configure Network Settings
            - Create VPC with private subnets (session-manager-vpc)
                - no endpoints vpc required for now
            - Create an Instance Security Group (instance-ssm-only)
                - Attach vpc (session-manager-vpc)
                - Does not require inbound rules
                - Leave outbound rules as default
            - create endpoint security group (endpoint-security-group)
                    - attach vpc (session-manager-vpc)
                    - define inbound rule to allow endpoints to accept HTTPS from 403 from a security group attached to our instance
                        - traffic: HTTPS
                        - port: 403
                        - source: instance-ssm-only
                    - leave outbound rules as default
            - Create VPC endpoints required for ssm
                - create new endpoints required for ssm
                - for each new endpoint
                    - attach vpc (session-manager-vpc)
                    - attach availability zones to a private subnet (no public IP)
                    - attach to endpoint security group (endpoint-security-group)

        CREATE EC2 INSTANCE
        - Create an EC2 Instance
            - Does not require key pair (thanks to Session Manager)
            - Attach IAM Instance role (session-manager-instance-role)
            - Attached to vpc (session-manager-vpc)
            - Attach either subnets
            - Attach instance security group (instance-ssm-only)

        CONNECT TO INSTANCE
            - Ensure correct setup
                - Systems Manager -> Session Manager or Fleet Manager
                    - instance should be visible
                    - selecting instance should note raise any exceptions
            - Connect with the Sessions Manager
                - Select an instance and Connect to Instance with Session Manager
                    - If connect button is greyed out, Systems Manager is not configured properly
                - aws ssm start-session --target i-xxx

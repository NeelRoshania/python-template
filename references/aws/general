CLI
    - Use high-level (s3) commands with the AWS CLI
        - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-s3-commands.html
    - check if logged in,
        - aws sts get-caller-identity
EC2 
    - Starting an EC2 instance, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html

ARNS
    - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is a string that uniquely identifies an AWS resource, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managedservices/latest/userguide/find-arn.html

POLICIES & PERMISSIONS
    - Policies and permissions in IAM, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json
    - Policies define define permissions for an action regardless of the method
        - users and/or resources utlize these actions to interact with the system
        - Policies are attached to instances and/or users to limit scope of actions

SECURITY GROUPS
    - Controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html
    - They are defined by VPC's, and control inbound and outbound traffic
    - The source of one security group can be the source for another as defined by inbound/outbound rules

VPC'S
    - Virtual Private Center's are virtual network dedicated to your AWS account and spans all of the Availability Zones in a Region (e.g. us-east-1)
    - VPC's can contain many public or private subnets (subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC.)
        - Subnets can be private, public, VPN-only or isolated-only 
    - Creating VPS's generate defaul security groups
    - References
        - VPC's, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-your-vpc.html
        - Subnets, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html

Service endpoints
    - An endpoint is the URL of the entry point for an AWS web service.
    - To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. 
    - Endpoints are attached to VPC's
        - availability zones are attached to a subnets
        - endpoints can be attached to security groups

SESSION MANAGER 

USAGE
    - aws ssm start-session --target i-xxx --region us-example-1
    - create a new user, sudo adduser newuser
    - su - newuser (instead of SSH'ing)
        - session manager usage negates the use of ssh

SETUP
    - EC2

        CONFIGURE PERMISSIONS, VPC AND ENDPOINTS
        - Configure IAM user
            - Create policy (session-manager-instance-role)
            - Create IAM user (developer)
                - Attach policy to user
        - Configure Instance
            - Create a policy for the Instance (session-manager-instance-policy)
            - Create an IAM role for the Instance (session-manager-instance-role)
                - Attach instance policy to instance role
        - Configure Network Settings
            - Create VPC with private subnets (session-manager-vpc)
                - no endpoints vpc required for now
            - Create an Instance Security Group (instance-ssm-only)
                - Attach vpc (session-manager-vpc)
                - Does not require inbound rules
                - Leave outbound rules as default
            - create endpoint security group (endpoint-security-group)
                    - attach vpc (session-manager-vpc)
                    - define inbound rule to allow endpoints to accept HTTPS from 403 from a security group attached to our instance
                        - traffic: HTTPS
                        - port: 403
                        - source: instance-ssm-only
                    - leave outbound rules as default
            - Create VPC endpoints required for ssm
                - create new endpoints required for ssm
                - for each new endpoint
                    - attach vpc (session-manager-vpc)
                    - attach availability zones to a private subnet (no public IP)
                    - attach to endpoint security group (endpoint-security-group)

        CREATE EC2 INSTANCE
        - Create an EC2 Instance
            - Does not require key pair (thanks to Session Manager)
            - Attach IAM Instance role (session-manager-instance-role)
            - Attached to vpc (session-manager-vpc)
            - Attach either subnets
            - Attach instance security group (instance-ssm-only)

        CONNECT TO INSTANCE
            - Ensure correct setup
                - Systems Manager -> Session Manager or Fleet Manager
                    - instance should be visible
                    - selecting instance should note raise any exceptions
            - Connect with the Sessions Manager
                - Select an instance and Connect to Instance with Session Manager
                    - If connect button is greyed out, Systems Manager is not configured properly
                - aws ssm start-session --target i-xxx
